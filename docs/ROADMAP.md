# Roadmap #
* Scrap Hong Kong latest suitation from http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/misc/latest_situation_of_reported_cases_wuhan_chi.csv
* Add filter and pagination to tables
* Remove RSS app wall, use direct API so that component style can be customized
* Refactor backend scrapper, identify common code
* Convert historical data table to line chart

# Nice to Have #
* Hints for how to interact with map (nice to have)
* Migrate to Vuex (Getter and setter to perform data transformation, remove `beforeMount()` and `watch()`)
